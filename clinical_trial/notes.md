Simple Randomization
    For small studies we can get unequal sizes
Can be solved with random permuted blocks
    Treatment become predictable at the end of each block
Stratified Randomization:
    * https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=randomized%20block%20design
    
Crossover trials
    Each patient is its own control
        Advantage: within-patient comparison
        Requires fewer patients
    Disadvantages:
        * Chronic, stable conditions
        * can only evalute short term efeects
        * carry over effects (order matters
    
Factorial Design
    * ineffective if there is an interaction and treatments are not independent 
    * Recieve treatmant A, or B, or both A & B or 2 placebos 

Equivalnce and non-Inferiorty Trials
    * Demonstrate similar efficacy between two treatments
     
Sample Size:
  * Adjust for the dropout rate      
    

Regression analsysis
    * Can see the drivers of endpoints
        * Can run regressions on different subgroups 
            * To avoid fishing for significant, they should be pre-specificied and there are sufficient sample sizes 

    * Interaction
    * bonferroni correctoin
        * divide the overall signficance level by the number of tests to generate new significance level
